## Bug Fix: Shield Display and Positioning for Boss

### Issue
- **Problem:** The shield for the Boss character was either not displayed or did not move along with the Boss as it changed positions on the screen.
- **Cause:** The shield image was initialized but not properly synchronized with the Boss's position during movement updates.

### Solution
To fix the shield display and positioning issue for the Boss, the following steps were taken:

1. **Initialize Shield with Boss in Constructor**
   - A `ShieldImage` instance was added as a property of the `Boss` class. This instance is created when the Boss is instantiated and is added to the main game root group for visibility.
   - Code snippet:
     ```java
     public Boss(Group root) {
         super(IMAGE_NAME, IMAGE_HEIGHT, INITIAL_X_POSITION, INITIAL_Y_POSITION, HEALTH);
         this.shieldImage = new ShieldImage(INITIAL_X_POSITION, INITIAL_Y_POSITION);
         root.getChildren().add(shieldImage);
     }
     ```

2. **Synchronize Shield Position with Boss**
   - To ensure the shield follows the Boss, the `updatePosition()` method in `Boss` was modified to update the shield’s layout position based on the Boss’s current coordinates.
   - Code snippet:
     ```java
     @Override
     public void updatePosition() {
         moveVertically(getNextMove());
         shieldImage.setLayoutX(getLayoutX());
         shieldImage.setLayoutY(getLayoutY());
     }
     ```

3. **Control Shield Visibility**
   - Modified the `updateShield()` method to control the visibility of the shield image based on whether the shield is active. When the shield is activated, `showShield()` is called, and when deactivated, `hideShield()` is called.
   - Code snippet:
     ```java
     private void updateShield() {
         if (isShielded) {
             framesWithShieldActivated++;
             shieldImage.showShield();
         } else if (shieldShouldBeActivated()) {
             activateShield();
             shieldImage.showShield();
         }
         if (shieldExhausted()) {
             deactivateShield();
             shieldImage.hideShield();
         }
     }
     ```

### Summary
This fix ensures that the shield image appears correctly when the Boss activates its shield and moves in sync with the Boss character. This improvement enhances visual accuracy and gameplay experience.
